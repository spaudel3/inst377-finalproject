Title of Project: The Hunter's Records

Description: This project has one main function: Being able to look up monsters and weapons from the video game "Monster Hunter World". Users can select which they want to search for with a drop-down menu. On the home page, users can also submit their favorite monster from the game and the most voted for monster is shown on the website.

Target Browsers: My target browser was web browsers on computer like Google Chrome. Though I haven't tested the project on phones, I believe that it would still work well on those platforms as there are a lot of dynamic elements that are based on the size of the screen. I made sure these dynamic elements worked by increasing and decreasing the size of the screen.
