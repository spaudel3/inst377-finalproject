// search bar at top of page, instructions for search functionality below
// below the instructions, are instructions for annyang functionality
// when search button is pressed, list of possible characters appears
// idk if i want to just have a list of text or to do something else
// names of characters are link that take the user to a fully dynamic page with information about the character and a picture
// need function that calls the API when the search button is pressed and reads the user's input
// find way to return a list of names from the API that act as links
// superhero API can return results for searched characters, append that to the HTML somehow
// the fully dynamic page will be difficult, and i don't know if it should be a page
// maybe a container that only shows up when the name/link is pressed, similar to the buttons from the dogs page in assignment 2
// if no valid results, tell the user to enter a valid name, either with an alert of on the page itself
// tbh i don't think this will be that bad (mightve jinxed myself)
